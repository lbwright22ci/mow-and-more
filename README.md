## Website Goals and Objectives

A static website to promote the work of a small gardening/outside maintenance service with the overall aim of increasing bookings and gaining more clients.  As one-man business based in a middle class residential area with a high proportion of older adults, the key strengths that the website needs to convey are a local, friendly, trustworthy. Potential customers need to feel comfortable and confident letting someone into their property.


## Target Audience

Based in a middle class residential area with a high proportion of older adults the target audience fits into two main categories:

* Elderly or infirm people living in their own property who want to enjoy their outside space but are unable to manage the upkeep of it all themselves.
    * Contact may also come from children or carers/friends of these individuals.
* Families and individuals of working age who enjoy the garden but work all week and don't have time or the inclination to look after it.  As well as routine upkeep, this group may also be interested in:
    * Holiday garden care: to keep on top of the grass, water plants etc to make sure everything is nice for when they return.
    * Pre-house sale tidy-ups to make sure the property looks its best for estate agent photos.

The vast majority of residents are homeowners with very few rental properties.  For this reason, services offered to landlords will not be specifically mentioned or targeted on the website.

## User Goals

* A potential customer is looking on the internet to find someone reliable and skilled who has the correct tools and knowlegde to take care of the garden or outside property maintenance tasks which they are either no longer able to do or don't have the time/desire to do.
* Things the website user wants to know about the business:
    * The range of services offered: can they get their grass cut? What about hedges or pressure washing the patio?
    * Will the job be done well?  
    * Can I trust this person in my home?  What do other people say about the quality of work?
    * How long to jobs take and how much does it cost?
    * Do you cover my area and what days of the week/hours of the day do you work?
    * How to get in touch and book a visit. 


## User Stories

* **_Easy navigation and responsive design to the website_**
    * I'm looking for someone to do outside garden and propery maintenance.  I need to be able to find the information I am looking for (such as services offered, locations, price ranges, testimonials, how to get in touch) quickly and easily on all type of device (mobile, tablet and laptop).  If I can't find what I need or get frustrated by the site I'll leave and look elsewhere.
* **_Key benefits of using the service_**
    * As a potential client I want to know why I should book 'Mow & More' rather than another service.
* **_Business information_**
    * As a potential customer I want to know if I live within the area covered by the service and what days of the week you do the work.
* **_Engaging descriptions of the services offered_**
    * As a potential customer I want to know more about what you can offer: Can you cut my hedge?  Will you take the garden waste away?  Do you have tools or do I have to provide them?  What's included in patio pressure-washing?
    * I'm going on holiday for a fortnight and want someone to look after the garden while I'm away- cut the lawn, do a spot of weeding and tend any problems (for peace of mind).  Is this something you can offer?
* **_High quality images of the services offered_**
    * As someone looking to sell my house I want to see high quality images of what you can do, to ensure that you are able to make my property look 'market ready'.
    * As a potential customer I want to see that if I pay you to do a job that the job will be done well.
* **_Estimated pricing_**
    * As a potential customer I know that the cost of any job will depend on the size of the property/garden but seeing some guideline prices gives me more confidence than no costs mentioned at all.
* **_Testimonials from past customers_**
    * Looking after the garden has become too much for me and I want someone to cut the grass once a fortnight, collecting the grass cuttings.  I want to know the job will be well done but also that the person I let into my home is reliable and trustworthy.  I find reading testimonials prior to booking reassuring and gives me more confidence in booking.
    * As the child or carer for an elderly relative I want to know that the person coming to do the work is trustworthy.
* **_Inquiry form to get a quote for my garden_**
    * I like the look of what you can offer and want to get a quote for you to come and do my garden.
* **_Alternative methods of communication_**
    * As an older adult, I'd rather speak to you on the phone after submitting the contact form than getting an email reply.
    * I don't trust contact forms and would like to be able to find a phone number on your website to get in touch that way.
* **_Keeping up-to-date with current projects and offers_**
    * As a potential customer, I want to be able to look at your social media accounts to see photos of recent jobs or any offers you may currently have.
    * I don't use social media but want to keep up to date with your offers and seasonal recommendations.  Can I subscribe to your newsletter?
* **_Professional accreditation and certification_**
    * As a potential customer I feel reassured when I see professional accreditation and certification for trades people I let into my house and garden.
* **_What happens next?_**
    * As a potential customer, what happens after I submit an inquiry form with you? Do you get in touch and do the job straight away?  Can I meet you in person first?  When will you be able to give me a quote?

## Design Choices

### Typography

* A heading font of Poppins (Bold 700 and Bold 800) was chosen specifically with the target audience of the website in mind: an easy to read font, professional in appearance and neat & tidy (like the gardening service). It is also a relatively commonly used font.  With a high proportion of potential users being older adults, having a common font makes the site more approachable.
* The [Font Pair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) tool was used to guide a font to be used alongside Poppins for body text: Hind (regular 400, semi bold 600).
* For contrast and a more 'familar look' to the quotation text, the font Trirong was choosen with the aid of [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/#).

Further typography styling rules for site consistency:

|Text type | Bootstrap display level | Font Family | Font decoration/ styling/ weight | Colour | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Sub Headings|Display 3|Poppins| bold|colour|Use of sentence case titles and headings (rather than capitalised or uppercase text) to give the page a more friendly appeal.|
|Service Headings|Display ?|Poppins| bold|colour| |
|Quotes from gardener| | Trirong| | | |
|Testimonial quotes| | Trirong| | | |
|Paragraph text| |Hind| regular|| |



### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen with green and earthy tones in mind.  Initial colours were generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and the hero image (a photo taken myself of a the front garden of a house with a flower border next to the house).  This colour palette was further refinded using the [WebAim Contrast Tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to maximise readability of text. 

![Image generated by Coolors of the colour palette to be used on the website](.docs-for-readme/design/garden-final.png "Hex codes for website colour palette")

This colour palette has been further verified for constrast and accessibility using the tool [Contrast-grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=264D32%0D%0A585423%0D%0AE1E0BC%0D%0AF0FFFF%0D%0ACEAB8D%0D%0A302118%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18).
