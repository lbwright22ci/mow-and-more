## Target Audience

Based in a middle class residential area with a high proportion of older adults the target audience fits into two main categories:

* Elderly or infirm people living in their own property who want to enjoy their outside space but are unable to manage the upkeep of it all themselves.
    * Contact may also come from children or carers/friends of these individuals.
* Families and individuals of working age who enjoy the garden but work all week and don't have time or the inclination to look after it.  As well as routine upkeep, this group may also be interested in:
    * Holiday garden care: to keep on top of the grass, water plants etc to make sure everything is nice for when they return.
    * Pre-house sale tidy-ups to make sure the property looks its best for estate agent photos.
